This version of cbmex is built against hardware library v3.06. (It's a modified version of the standard cbmex in NSP folder)
It's not compatible with lower version of NSP Central built with hw lib v3.05. 

keep the .mexw32 and rename all others. the .mexw32 was copied from the cerebus file folder (hw lib v3.06). 
the previous dll files from Hydrum didn't work after the firmware and software upgrade.
